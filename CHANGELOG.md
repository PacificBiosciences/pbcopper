# pbcopper - CHANGELOG

## Active

### TODO
- Interface groups
- Initial sequence-related data structures

### Added
- Add gtest as submodule
- RSMovieName & RSReadName: Sequel and RSII movie names are composed of
different data, and thus need to be handled separately. MovieName & ReadName
handle Sequel-style data as the default.

- **PacBio::Utility** : miscellaneous utilities
  - CallbackTimer - schedule periodic callback invokation (or delayed
  single-shot)
